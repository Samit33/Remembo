Our app sends the extracted page's data to Google Gemini. We have prompted Google Gemini to create learning cards, review cards, and quiz cards based on the extracted page's content. Additionally, Gemini helps us create a spaced repetition learning schedule for the users, optimizing their long-term retention. Gemini consistently follows our instructions in the prompt and with the help of Gemini 1.5 PRO's structured output generation, we are able to reliably generate the exact output and connect it with the Flutter frontend.
